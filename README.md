# Animal-Crossing
Animal Crossing is an Nintendo's social simulation video game and has been considered as one of the most favorited nintendo games in existence. This is an Animal Crossing website
where users can share their friend codes so that the users can travel to one another's islands and can also purchase amiibo cards. 
Users can then access amiibo characters as their neighbors.

## Tools Used
I designed my website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with few boostraps, and applied a web framework called Flask while setting up my database with a NoSQL database, Pymongo.

## What is the motivation behind it?
I have learned about the web framework called Flask this past semester and I wanted to apply this knowledge into my favorite game, Animal Crossing, and decided to make the website.

## Why create an Animal Crossing Website?
During the COVID-19 quarantine, Animal Crossing was a trending game throughout the world. Being able to share your friend-code with players and being able to travel to other playersâ€™ islands made the game more interactive and enjoyable.
Thus, I wanted to create a webiste where Animal Crossing players can share their friend codes with new people to interact with one another for their own purposes and also thought it would be great for users 
to be able to purchase amiibo cards through my website so that the players can use their amiibo card characters in order to make them their neighbors. 

## URL for my website

## Problems that I faced
Since I am a beginner to Flask, I faced problems with associating my collections for Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions. I also faced problems with implementing session in Flask for users to be able to register, login and logout.

## How I Solved My Problems
I was able to solve my problems by looking back through my old projects that used Flask with Pymongo, and I also watched several youtube videos to implement session into my Flask.
